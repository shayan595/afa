    <h1>14 august 1947</h1>
    <p>Independence Day (Urdu: یومِ آزادی; Yāum-e-Āzādi), observed annually on 14 August, is a national holiday in
        Pakistan. It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state
        following the termination of the British Raj in August of 1947. Pakistan came into existence as a result of the
        Pakistan Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of
        British India via partition.[1][2][3] The movement was led by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership
        of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British
        Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan which comprised West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East
        Pakistan (now Bangladesh). During that time, In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided with
        Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being Laylat al-Qadr, is regarded as sacred by Muslims.

        The main Independence Day ceremony takes place in Islamabad, where the national flag is hoisted at the
        Presidential and Parliament buildings. It is followed by the national anthem and live televised speeches by
        leaders. Usual celebratory events and festivities for the day include flag-raising ceremonies, parades, cultural
        events, and the playing of patriotic songs. A number of award ceremonies are often held on this day, and
        Pakistanis hoist the national flag atop their homes or display it prominently on their vehicles and attire.</p>
    <h2>Flag Day</h2>
    <p>Flag Day, also called National Flag Day, in the United States, a day honouring the national flag, observed on
        June 14. The holiday commemorates the date in 1777 when the United States approved the design for its first
        national flag.

        The idea to set aside a day to honour the national flag came from several sources. Bernard J. Cigrand, a
        Wisconsin schoolteacher, in 1885 urged his students to observe June 14 as “Flag Birthday.” He later wrote an
        essay published in a Chicago newspaper that urged Americans to proclaim this date as the day to celebrate the
        flag. In 1888 William T. Kerr of Pennsylvania founded the American Flag Day Association of Western Pennsylvania,
        an organization to which he dedicated his life. A lesser-known claim is that of George Morris of Connecticut,
        who is said to have organized the first formal celebration of the day in Hartford in 1861.

        In 1916 Pres. Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 as the official date for Flag Day, and in 1949 the U.S. Congress
        permanently established the date as National Flag Day. Although Flag Day is not an official federal holiday,
        Pennsylvania celebrates the day as a state holiday. Each year the U.S. president delivers an address that
        proclaims the week of June 14 as National Flag Week, and all Americans are encouraged to fly U.S. flags during
        that week.</p>
